# CLAUDE.md — washcalc.app

Per-project orientation for Claude. Read this first when picking up
work on this site. Index of conventions, deferred decisions, and
non-features that aren't obvious from the code or git history.

## Project

<1-2 sentence description — fill in: what does this site do, who is
the user, what is the stack (washcalc.app runs on the sites/* workspace
shared infra: Vite or Astro + pnpm + Cloudflare Pages, with Makefile
forwarding to the central builder).>

## Commands

```bash
# Build / dev (forwards to the parent Makefile)
make deps           # install deps via the central builder
make dev            # local dev server
make build          # production build → dist/

# Test (per-stack — adjust as needed)
make test           # if a test suite is wired in

# Deploy
git push            # Cloudflare Pages auto-builds on push to main
```

## Conventions

  - Build path: this project's `Makefile` → `../Makefile` (parent
    workspace) → `~/work/projects/builder/` (central builder).
  - Stack: pnpm-only. No `package-lock.json` / `bun.lockb` / `yarn.lock`.
  - Deploy: Cloudflare Pages via `wrangler.jsonc`. No `_redirects`
    SPA fallback (uses CF's `not_found_handling` instead).

## Deferred decisions

<Things deliberately *not* shipped. Append entries with rationale so
future Claude sessions don't re-propose them.>
